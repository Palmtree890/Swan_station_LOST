# Swan Station *LOST*
This is a replica of the familiar countdown timer from the TV show LOST. It is written in python and is avalible for 
linux, mac, and windows.
I made this to get better at python so if you have any recomendations please fork this and add them, then submit a pull request.
## How to install
first clone the repo
```bash
https://github.com/Palmtree890/Swan_station_LOST
```
Then cd into the repo
```bash
cd Swan_station_LOST
ls
```
Then you will make the venv (this will very from OS but I will include intructions for both)

###FOR WINDOWS
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
###for Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/acivate
```
###For Mac
same as linux, just change python3 to python
